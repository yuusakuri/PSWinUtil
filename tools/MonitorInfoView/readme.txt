Using MonitorInfoView
=====================

MonitorInfoView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, just copy the executable file
(MonitorInfoView) to any folder you like, and run it.
The main window of MonitorInfoView has 2 panes: The top pane displays the
list of monitors, and when selecting a monitor in the the top pane, the
bottom pane displays the list of supported display modes for the selected
monitor.
For most computers, you'll find only one Monitor item in the top pane.
But if you have multiple monitors connected to your system, you should
have one Monitor item for each monitor.
